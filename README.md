# mcp-sdk-js-playground
A playground for experimenting with the MCP SDK in JavaScript. Just testing, learning, and having fun. ðŸš€

## Development

To start the development server with the MCP inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node ./index.mjs
```

This will launch the MCP inspector interface where you can test and debug your MCP server.

You can then open the MCP Inspector at http://127.0.0.1:6274 to see the server's capabilities and interact with them.

## Resources

- [Official TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) - The official TypeScript SDK for Model Context Protocol servers and clients

These SDKs provide language-specific abstractions that simplify working with the MCP protocol, allowing you to focus on implementing the core logic of your servers or clients rather than dealing with low-level protocol details.
